<h1>Chapter 6. Printing and Plotting</h1>
<p>You can produce print-outs of your spider-graph data on either
the LaserWriter or the Colour Plotter, which are attached to the
system network. These hard copies can only be of the colour
screen.</p>
<p>As the LaserWriter can only print in black its main use is to
provide print-outs of the aircraft trips data set out in the form
of a spider graph. The eight pen colour plotter is used to provide
colour copies of the crewing patterns that have been developed.</p>
<h2>6.1. Black and White Printing</h2>
<p>On the LaserWriter you print, in black and white, whatever you
can display on the colour screen. The most common use is to produce
hard copies of the aircraft trips data spider graphs (without any
of the colour patterns displayed) .</p>
<p>Left-click on the <strong>Plot</strong> button In the
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. The <strong>Plotting of Patterns
and Schedules</strong> window appears (see <a href=
"Printing.html#Print_Plot_Cap" title=
"Figure 6.1. Plotting of Patterns and Schedules">Figure 6.1,
"Plotting of Patterns and Schedules"</a>).</p>

Schedules</b></p>

<p>By left-clicking on <strong>Plotter Type</strong> you can select
the printer used -- if you select a LaserJet printer, then the
printing will be in black &amp; white. Other parameters are set by
clicking on the selection buttons underneath the
<strong>Plot</strong> label: select <strong>Grid and
Labels</strong>, <strong>Flights</strong> and
<strong>Service/Aircraft</strong>. You can also specify a title of
up to 20 characters for the print-out typing in the
<strong>Title</strong> field.</p>
<p>To plot your choices from the colour screen, left-click on the
<strong>Plot</strong> button on the top row of this panel. This
button will be shaded, and then clear.</p>
<p>(You do not need to wait for each plot to be produced by the
Laser Writer before you send off your next plot. XBO-Edit allows
users to spool plots to the LaserWriter). The
<strong>Replot</strong> button causes all the plots you have sent
off during this session to be plotted again. Finally, to leave this
window, left-click on the <strong>Done</strong>button.</p>
<h2>6.2. Colour Printing</h2>
<p>You can also obtain a colour print-out of the screen. Colour
plotting code has been developed using the Hewlett-Packard Graphics
Language (HP-GL).</p>
<p>To produce a colour plot of your colour screen, left-click on
the <strong>Plot</strong> button in the <strong>Control
Panel</strong>. The <strong>Plotting of Patterns and
Schedules</strong> window will appear (see <a href=
"Printing.html#Print_Plot_Cap" title=
"Figure 6.1. Plotting of Patterns and Schedules">Figure 6.1,
"Plotting of Patterns and Schedules"</a>).</p>
<p>You need to alter <strong>Plotter Type</strong>. Left-click on
the <strong>Plotter Type</strong> option menu, and select the
colour plotter.</p>
<p>The page size is set to A4. To select A3 left-click on
<strong>Page size</strong>. You may have to feed non-standard paper
sizes into the plotter by hand. The eight colour pens are labelled
P1 to PS, and in this window the default is that the <strong>Grid,
Text</strong> and <strong>Flights</strong> are all set to the same
colour: P1. To alter these, press the right mouse button on the
<strong>P</strong> character. The list of pen names pops up and you
move the cursor to the one you want and release the right mouse
button.</p>

<tr>
<td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">
<p>It is best to keep the various colour pens in a fixed order in
the plotter.</p>
</td>

</table>
<p>The right hand column allows you to plot <strong>Grid &amp;
Labels</strong>, <strong>Flights</strong>,
<strong>Service/Aircraft</strong>, <strong>Horizontal Pattern
Names</strong>, <strong>Ports on Both Sizes</strong> or any
combination of these. You can also enter a title, of up to 20
characters for each plot.</p>
<p>To plot your choice from the colour screen left-click on the
<strong>Plot</strong> button on the top row of this window. The
<strong>Plot</strong> button will be shaded, and then clear. (You
do not need to wait for each plot to be produced before you send
off your next plot. XBO-Edit allows users to spool plots). The
<strong>Replot</strong> button causes all the plots you sent off
during this session to be plotted again. Finally, to leave this
window, left-click on the <strong>Done</strong> button.</p>
